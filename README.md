See the [PMM docs](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html) for more information.


## Submitting Bug Reports

If you find a bug in our fork of PMM Client or one of the related forked projects, you should submit a github issue.

Your first step should be to search the existing set of open tickets for a similar report. If you find that someone else has already reported your problem, then you can upvote that report to increase its visibility.

If there is no existing report, submit a report by filling in the summary, description, steps to reproduce, and affected version as best as you can. If the bug corresponds to a crash, attach the stack trace from the logs.

An excellent resource is [Elika Etemad's article on filing good bug reports.](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/).

As a general rule of thumb, please try to create bug reports that are:

- *Reproducible.* Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- *Specific.* Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- *Unique.* Do not duplicate existing tickets.
- *Scoped to a Single Bug.* One bug per report.
